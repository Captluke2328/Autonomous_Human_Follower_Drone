I'm not sure if drone still move if not person is detected.
I assume drone still move forward considering self.vehicle.groundspeed = 3 in control.tab.py.
If yes. we need to ensure the drone to remain static if no object is detected. 

Therefore have to modify this code in main.py:
def search(id):
    start = time.time()
    drone.control_tab.stop_drone()
    while time.time() - start < state.get_time():
        if (id == 1):
            state.set_system_state("track")
    state.set_system_state("land")

in control.tab
def stop_drone(self):
    self.engine.send_movement_command_YAW(0)
    self.engine.executeChangesNow(0, 0, 0)

    new added **
    self.vehicle.groundspeed = 0


consider to use 0b0000111111100011 for altitude
